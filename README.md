* It's free to fork! If you want new feature or language translation, just fork it!
* Currently only typo or tsv data fix contribution are allowed.

## How to  use
* **ADD `token.txt` FILE to the `DiscordBot` and/or the same folder with the `.exe` application (same folder as `setting.json`) AND PUT ONLY TOKEN TO THERE**! Do not put any other data there.
  * If you are a Discord developer, you can claim token in Developer Portal.
 
# Other stuffs
* Currently uses only slash command.
* No Gateway Intent is requried.
* At least slash command permission is required.

# Using image
* Currnetly the image is from [here](https://github.com/rnielikki/pata/tree/main/!imgs/bot/Images).
  * (You can use that one, but I am not responsible if I forget and remove that repo in future lol)
* You can use either this or download `Images.zip` from here and host by yourself.
  * When you host with the folder name, DO include the `Images` folder name itself in settings!
  * Example is the link above, and in the `settings.json`!
